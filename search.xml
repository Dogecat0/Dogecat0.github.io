        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Intro"><a title="Intro" class="headerlink" href="#Intro"></a>Intro</h2><p>I’ve been building a Python based website for a while now which mainly focuses on backend development using Django (The project is currently still under development, link to the demo repo: <a href="https://github.com/Dogecat0/inomad-demo">INOMAD</a>).</p><p>This Django project is my first web development project and a self-taught one. Although there has been some involvement of JavaScript in the project, I’ve never really had the chance to learn JavaScript in-depth, which seems quite essential for mordern web development. So, I’ve decided to start a full-stack course and also begin this series of blog posts about my learning journey. I believe it will help me reinforce the web development concepts I’ve learned so far, as well as learn new tools in a more structured way.</p><h2 id="Content"><a title="Content" class="headerlink" href="#Content"></a>Content</h2><p>This series will mainly cover the following topics based on the course itself:</p><ul><li>Fundamentals of Web Apps</li><li>React</li><li>Prgramming a server with Node.js and Express.js</li><li>Testing Express servers and React apps</li><li>User administration</li><li>Advanced state management</li><li>React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack</li><li>GraphQL</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>React Native</li><li>CI/CD</li><li>Containers</li><li>Relationship databases</li></ul><h2 id="Course-Details"><a title="Course Details" class="headerlink" href="#Course-Details"></a>Course Details</h2><p>You can find the full course details in the following link: <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/about">Full Stack Open</a></p>]]></content>
