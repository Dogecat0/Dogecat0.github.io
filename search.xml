This Django project is my first web development project and a self-taught one. Although there has been some involvement of JavaScript in the project, I’ve never really had the chance to learn JavaScript in-depth. So, I’ve decided to start a full-stack course and also begin this series of blog posts about my learning journey. I believe it will help me review the web development concepts I’ve learned so far, as well as learn new tools in a more structured way.</p><h2 id="Content"><a href="#Content" class="headerlink" title="Content"></a>Content</h2><p>This series will mainly cover the following topics based on the course itself:</p><ul><li>Fundamentals of Web Apps</li><li>React</li><li>Prgramming a server with Node.js and Express.js</li><li>Testing Express servers and React apps</li><li>User administration</li><li>Advanced state management</li><li>React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack</li><li>GraphQL</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>React Native</li><li>CI&#x2F;CD</li><li>Containers</li><li>Relationship databases</li></ul><h2 id="Course-Details"><a href="#Course-Details" class="headerlink" title="Course Details"></a>Course Details</h2><p>You can find the full course details in the following link: <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/about">Full Stack Open</a></p>]]></content>
